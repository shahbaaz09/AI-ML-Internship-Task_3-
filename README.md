# AI-ML-Internship-Task_3-
🏠 Linear Regression - Housing Price Prediction

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship Task 3. The objective is to implement and understand linear regression using a real-world dataset related to housing prices.

---

📌 Task Overview

- Understand how linear regression works
- Load and clean the dataset
- Train a model using scikit-learn
- Evaluate the model using MAE, MSE, and R² score
- Visualize the regression line
- Interpret the model coefficients


📂 Dataset

*Source*: [Kaggle - Housing Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

- File used: housing.csv
- Target variable: price
- Feature used: area (for simple regression)

---

## 🧠 Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## 🧪 Model Evaluation

- *Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*: Printed in notebook
- *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*: Printed in notebook
- *R² Score*: Printed in notebook

These scores help evaluate how well the model fits the data.

---

## 📉 Visualization

The notebook includes a regression plot showing:

- Blue dots: Actual housing prices
- Red line: Predicted prices (regression line)

## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Make sure housing.csv is in the same directory
4. Run all cells in order
